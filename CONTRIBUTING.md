# Contributing to LLM mGBA - Universal AI Game Player

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this universal AI gaming framework! This project aims to enable LLMs to play any Game Boy Advance game through visual understanding and decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Vision

While this framework started with Pokémon Red (based on [martoast/LLM-Pokemon-Red](https://github.com/martoast/LLM-Pokemon-Red)), our goal is to create a universal system that can play any GBA game. The architecture is designed to be:

- **Game-agnostic**: Core systems work with any GBA title
- **Modular**: Game-specific logic is contained in separate modules
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new games and AI behaviors
- **Developer-friendly**: Comprehensive tools for debugging and monitoring

## 🎮 Priority Contribution Areas

### 1. New Game Support (High Priority)
Help expand the framework to support additional GBA games:

**Target Games**:
- 🏃 **Platformers**: Super Mario Advance series, Sonic games
- ⚔️ **Action/Adventure**: The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap, Metroid series
- 🎖️ **Strategy/RPG**: Fire Emblem series, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
- 🏁 **Racing**: Mario Kart: Super Circuit, F-Zero series
- 🥊 **Fighting**: Street Fighter Alpha series, Tekken Advance

**What's Needed**:
- Game-specific knowledge modules
- Memory address mappings for game state
- AI prompt templates optimized for each game
- Game-specific image processing if needed

### 2. LLM Provider Support
Expand AI model compatibility:
- OpenAI GPT-4 Vision integration
- Anthropic Claude 3 Vision support
- Local model integration (LLaVA, etc.)
- Multi-model ensemble approaches

### 3. Framework Improvements
Enhance the core system:
- Performance optimizations
- Better error handling and recovery
- Enhanced debugging tools
- Cross-platform compatibility improvements

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Adding a New Game

1. **Create Game Module**:
   ```
   games/your_game/
   ├── controller.py      # Game-specific controller
   ├── knowledge_system.py # Game knowledge and memory
   ├── game_engine.py     # Game state management
   └── prompt_template.py # AI prompts for this game
   ```

2. **Memory Mapping**:
   - Identify key memory addresses for game state
   - Map player position, health, inventory, etc.
   - Document memory layout in game engine

3. **AI Prompts**:
   - Create game-specific prompt templates
   - Define game objectives and strategies
   - Include game controls and mechanics

4. **Configuration**:
   - Add game config to `config_your_game.json`
   - Update main config to support new game selection

### Code Style Guidelines

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings for all public methods
- **Testing**: Add tests for new functionality
- **Logging**: Use the existing logging system for consistency

### File Structure
```

```

## 🧪 Testing Your Contribution

1. **Unit Tests**: Add tests for new modules
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/test_your_game.py
   ```

2. **Integration Test**: Test with actual game
   ```bash
   python test_complete_system.py --game your_game
   ```

3. **Dashboard Test**: Verify dashboard integration
   ```bash
   python dashboard.py --config config_your_game.json
   ```

## 📝 Submission Guidelines

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork and Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-metroid-support
   ```

2. **Follow Naming Conventions**:
   - `feature/game-name-support` for new games
   - `enhancement/description` for improvements
   - `fix/issue-description` for bug fixes

3. **Include Documentation**:
   - Update README.md if needed
   - Add game-specific setup instructions
   - Document any new configuration options

4. **Test Thoroughly**:
   - Test your game module extensively
   - Verify dashboard integration works
   - Check that existing functionality isn't broken
